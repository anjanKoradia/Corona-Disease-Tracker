              The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry
              cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion,
              runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
              mild and begin gradually. Also the symptoms may appear 2-14 days
              after exposure.

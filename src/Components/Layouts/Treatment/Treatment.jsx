          <p>
            Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by a
            newly discovered coronavirus.

              To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to
              prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should
              receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness
              should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive
              care.

            <p>
              Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses.
              Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the
              illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people,
              until you have recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a
              healthy diet, sleep, stay active, and make social contact with
              loved ones through the phone or internet. Children need extra love
              and attention from adults during difficult times. Keep to regular
              routines and schedules as much as possible.

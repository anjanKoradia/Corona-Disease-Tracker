            <p>
              Everyone must stay at home to help stop the spread of coronavirus.
              You should only leave the house for very limited purposes:
            </p>
            <ul className="whatToDo_list">
              <li>
                Shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine,
                which must be as important.
              </li>
              <li>
                One form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk dâ€“ alone or
                with members of your household.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid or escape
                risk of injury or harm, or to provide care or to help a
                vulnerable person.
              </li>
              <li>
                Travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work
                from home.
              </li>
              <li>
                Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at
                home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get
                medical care. Do not visit public areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines,
                such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
              </li>
            </ul>

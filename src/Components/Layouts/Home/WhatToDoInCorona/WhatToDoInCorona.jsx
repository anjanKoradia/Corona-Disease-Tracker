              One form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk dâ€“ alone or

              Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid or escape risk
              of injury or harm, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable
              person.
            </li>
            <li>
              Travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from

              Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at
              home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get
              medical care. Do not visit public areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such
              as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
